    "In Korean online messages, it's common to see typos caused by quick typing habits or intentional simplifications, as well as uniquely Korean 'netspeak' (informal or altered text styles). These phenomena often rely on phonetic similarities or typing shortcuts, which can be quite confusing, especially when translating online content. Below are some common examples:\n"
    "Vowel omission: Certain vowels are skipped or simplified. For example, '안녕하세요' (hello) might be written as '안뇽.'\n"
    "Consonant simplification: Complex double consonants are reduced to single ones, such as 'ㅋㅋㅋ' (laughter) shortened to 'ㅋ'.\n"
    "Homophonic substitutions: Words are replaced with phonetically similar ones. For instance, '뭐해?' (what are you doing?) might be typed as '머해?'\n"
    "Shape-based substitutions: Characters or symbols with similar shapes are used interchangeably, like 'ㅎㅎ' (a laughing sound) written as 'ㄲㄲ'.\n"
    "Use of numbers and symbols: Numbers or symbols mimic pronunciations or shapes, such as '사랑해' (I love you) written as '4랑해.'\n"
    "Word abbreviations: Long phrases are shortened, like '고맙습니다' (thank you) becoming '감사.'\n"
    "Creative netspeak: New forms are created based on pronunciation or appearance, e.g., '재미없어' (boring) simplified to '잼없어'.\n"
    "Typing errors: Mistyped syllables due to speed, such as '몰라' (I don't know) being typed as '롤마'.\n\n"
